## 
* Atomicity: all the steps of a transaction is succeeded or failed together, no partial state, all or nothing.
* Consistency: all data in the database is consistent at the end of transaction.
* Isolation: only one transaction can touch the data in the same time, other transactions wait until completion of the working transaction.
* Durability: data is persisted in the database at the end of the transaction.
